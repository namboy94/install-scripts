# Installation Scripts

This is a collection of Installation scripts for various purposes.Each included script is non-destructive, i.e.
it won't break anything if run twice. Script files that begin with 'd_' are the exception to this.

These are mostly for personal use, but feel free to submit issues or contribute code.
